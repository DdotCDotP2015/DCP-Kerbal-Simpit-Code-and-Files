# DCP-Kerbal-Simpit-Code-and-Files
Arduino Code and 3D print files for my kerbal simpit

   This is a simple code, by a simple man, for a simple controller
   It controls x Buttons, Throttle, y Toggle switches
   If you are brand new, I suggest getting the Arduino starter kit
   and completing the following tutorials:
   
      . Code Structure: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-code-structure
      
      . Serial Monitor: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-serial-monitor
      
      . LED Blink: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-led-blink
      
      . Button: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-button
      
      . On-Off Switch: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-switch
      
      . Debounce: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-button-debounce
      
      . EZButton: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-button-library
      
      . Potentiometer: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-potentiometer

      They're super easy and quick, and should give you just enough knowledge to know what's going on below.
